# A Clustering Problem

The analysis is based on this [Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/na4797/clustering-kmeans-hierarchical-comparison/data). 

The data contains socioeconomic indicators for 167 countries. The aim of the analysis is to identify the countries which should be targeted for financial help by an international NGO. 

We will first perform EDA to explore and understand the data. 

We shall explore two clustering techniques, K-Means and Hierarchical clustering.
